# BootConPresCode
This is my solo project I made, the purpose was to utilize bash scripting to make nmap a little easier to use and eliminate some of the memorization normally req'd. Please look at 0_nmapApp for the poroject as the rest were me simply testing stuff out and seeing what works and what doesn't. I aalso have video of me presenting this that is about 16mins long
